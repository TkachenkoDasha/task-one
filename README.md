# task-one
## The project consists of 9 packages, each of which contains one task. Each task is a program for solving a simple task, created for training beginners in Java:
1. task1: A program, that display the specified result as one line, using the call to the `println()` method. The result of the output is given as: 

  >Один
  
  >Два
  
  >Три

2. task2: Finding the mistakes in the code and fixing them:

```for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
int sum = 0;
sum = sum + i;
}
System.out.println{"Cyммa: " + sum);
```

3. task3: A program that finds even numbers from 0 to n.
4. task4: A program that finds the sum and product of numbers from 0 to n.
5. task5: A program with the loop that iterates over values from 1000 to 0 in increments -2.
6. task6: A program for entering n lines from the console, finding the shortest and longest line, displaying the found lines and their lengths.
7. task7: A program for entering n lines from the console, outputting to the console those lines, the length of which is less (more) than the average and their length.
8. task8: A program for entering n words from the console, searching for a word consisting only of different characters. If there are several such words, search for the first one.
9. task9: A program for entering a number from 1 to 12 and displaying to the console the name of the month corresponding to this number. (Check the correctness of entering numbers).
